# About
Crates aims to be an extensible gats.io client written in Rust and Node.js.

# Why?
The official gats.io client is web-based and currently written in vanilla JS, which is not the best for performance.  
Notably, the client is also somewhat inflexible in terms of modding and does not provide a good modding API.
